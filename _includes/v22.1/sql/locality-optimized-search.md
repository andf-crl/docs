Note that the [SQL engine](../{{ page.[version](cluster-settings.html#setting-version).[version](cluster-settings.html#setting-version) }}/architecture/sql-layer.html) will avoid sending requests to nodes in other regions when it can instead read a value from a unique column that is stored locally. This capability is known as [_locality optimized search_](../{{ page.[version](cluster-settings.html#setting-version).[version](cluster-settings.html#setting-version) }}/cost-based-optimizer.html#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters).
