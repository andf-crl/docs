<span class="[version](cluster-settings.html#setting-version)-tag">New in v20.2:</span> CockroachDB now supports uploading files to a [user-scoped file storage](use-userfile-for-bulk-operations.html) using a SQL connection. We recommend using `userfile` instead of `nodelocal`, as it is user-scoped and more secure.
