CockroachDB distributes a single binary that contains both core and [enterprise features](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/). You can use core features without any license key. However, to use the enterprise features, you need either a trial or an [enterprise.license](cluster-settings.html#setting-enterprise-license) key.

This page lists enterprise features. For information on how to obtain and set trial and [enterprise.license](cluster-settings.html#setting-enterprise-license) keys for CockroachDB, see the [Licensing FAQs](licensing-faqs.html#obtain-a-license).
